A mod to change the font in FFXI to FFVI's font

For reporting issues, please use the issues feature in this github repo. 

Before reporting an issue, download the latest version to see if the issue has been resolved. 

Please include an image and a detailed description so that I can quickly address it. There are a number of different fonts that are being manipulated and as such, it is time consuming to track them down without a detailed description. Also be aware, that SE uses a variable sized font, whereas FFVI used a fixed size font, the result is that certain letters like 'W' tend to not fit in the space that FFXI gives them. If you have a critique of this nature, please also open an issue and we can discuss and address as possible.

Thank you for checking out my FFVI mod!
