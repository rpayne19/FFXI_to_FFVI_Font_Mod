The folder structure in this git repo matches the paths that the files should go in the 'FINAL FANTASY XI' folder. Note, the ones in the '0' folder are the window mods. They correspond with window configurations 6, 7, and 8 respectively.

For reporting issues, please use the issues feature in this github repo. Please include an image and a detailed description so that I can quickly address it. There are a number of different fonts that are being manipulated and as such, it is time consuming to track them down without a detailed description. Also be aware, that SE uses a variable sized font, whereas FFVI used a fixed size font, the result is that certain letters like 'W' tend to not fit in the space that FFXI gives them. If you have a critique of this nature, please also open an issue and we can discuss and address as possible.

Thank you for checking out my FFVI mod!

Known issues to be address in the future:

-Inconsistencies with fonts on the macro buttons
-Red arrow buttons indicating there's another menu need to be improved
-Improve the network activity indicators
